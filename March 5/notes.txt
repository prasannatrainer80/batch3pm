throws keyword will at method level, where throw keyword will be at code level.

throws keyword used to throw exception classes, where throw keyword used to throw exception objects.

throws keyword simply ignores the exceptions by default, as throw keyword to be raised once the control to be redirected to corresponding catch block.
