Cloud Computing : It is an internet based computing service, in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow centralized data storage. For that we can provie access to services and resources.

Using cloud computing, organizations can use shared computing and storage resources rather than building, operating, and improving infrastructure on their own. 


Cloud Computing is a combination of 

	-> Mobile 
	-> Applications
	-> Database
	-> Storage
	-> Servers
	
Features : 
__________

	-> User can have provision and release resources on demand.

	-> Resources acn be scaled up automatically depending on the load

	-> Resources are accessaible over a network with proper security

	-> Cloud service providers can enable a pass-as-you-go model, where customers are charged based on
		the thype of resources and per usage. 

	Types of Cloud

		-> Deployment Model  

			(a) public cloud  : 

				-> Scalable

				-> Reliable

				-> Inexpensive

				-> Location Dependent

		In public cloud the thrid party providers make resources and services avaialble to their
			customers via internet. Customer's data and related security is with service providers owned infrastructure.

			(b) private cloud

				-> Scalable

				-> Secure 

				- Flexible

				-> You have your own control

		Provide cloud also provides almost similar features as public cloud, but the data and services are managed by the org. or by the third party only for the customer's org. In this cloud, major control is over the infra. so security related issues are minimized. 

			(c) Hybrid Cloud

				Scalable

				Secure

				Flexible

				Cost Effective

		Hybrid cloud is combination of both private and public cloud, the decision to run on private or public clould depends on various parameters like sensitivity of data and applications. 

		-> Service Model


Cloud Service Models : 
______________________


	There are three types of service models in cloud

	-> IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)   Server Storage Network and Infrastructure & Network Architects 

	-> PAAS (Platform as a Service) Operating System & Application softwares compatabile to the OS etc...

	-> SAAS (Software as a Service) Packaged Software OS & APlication stacks like (eclipsed, vscode, mysql) these softwares are deployed 
				those cloud labs are ready to use. 

SAAS will be used by end users
PAAS will be used by Application Developers
IAAS will be by Network Architects.


What is Azure 
	
	Microsft azure is a set of cloud services to build, manage and deploy applciations on a network with help of tools and frameworks. 

It contains DataCenter as centralized location where computing and networking equipment is concentrated for storing, processing and distributing large volume of data. 


Azure contains lot of services as


-> Computed Services for build level products  Contains Virtual Machine
