Data Types : 
______________

int

numeric(9,2) -> Total 9 digits in that 2 are decimal places 

char

varchar

date 

time

datetime

enum

The difference between char and varchar is, if you specify char(10) and used only 4 chars, then remaining 6 chars are wasted as redundancy is high

but, if you take varchar(10) and used only 4 chars, remaining 6 chars are added back to memory. 

by default mysql follows yyyy-MM-dd format to insert or update date field(s) 

ENUM allows you to enter only group of valid values.  Example 

i want to enter gender value as MALE or FEMALE 

enum('MALE','FEMALE')


Employee 
  
    Empno (int) Primary Key
    Name varchar(30) NOT NULL
    Gender ENUM('MALE','FEMALE') 
    Dept varchar(30)
    Desig varchar(30)
    Basic Numeric(9,2) 


EmployPayroll

   empno (INT) Primary Key
   name  varchar(30) NOT NULL
   gender ENUM(MALE, FEMALE)
   salary  numeric(9,2) 
   salaryDate Date
   ManagerId INT 

Please make primary key on Empno + SalaryDate

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

EmployDetails
    Empno+, Name, Gender, Department, Desig,Basic
LeaveDetails
    LeaveId+, EmpNo-, LeaveStartDate, LeaveEndDate, LeaveReason, LeaveType, ManagerComments 


LeaveDetails is the child table for EmployDetails, 

as Empno is primary key in EmployDetails table, and foreign key in LeaveDetails table. 


Restaurant(RestaurantID+, RestaurantName, City, Location, Rating, MobileNo, Email)

Menu(MenuID+, RestaurantID-, ItemName, Price, ItemType) 

ResturantId is foreign key in Menu Table, its primary key in Resturant Table 

MenuId make it as auto-increment
