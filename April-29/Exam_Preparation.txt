1) What is Problem 

2) What is Problem Solving

 Definition: A problem is a puzzle that requires logical thought or mathematics to 
solve
 • What is Problem solving ?
 The act of defining a problem; determining its cause; identifying, prioritizing and 
selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing that solution

3) How the problem solving classified

Problem Classification
 • Concurrent:  Operations overlap in time
 • Sequential:  Operations are performed in a step-by-step manner
 • Distributed:  Operations are performed at different locations
 • Event-Based:  Operations are performed based on the input

Which Problem Solving technique ensures need to follow step by step approach to solve

Sequential

4) Which problem methodology ensures we can write code directly without dealing
with env.

Brute Force


5) Which problem methodology ensures, the code must be efficient and optimized

Greedy

6) Which problem methodology ensures, the problem broken into pieces when its not solved

DIvide and COnquer

7) Difference between Divide and Conquer and Dynamic Programming 
dynamic programming makes a program as subprogram, each unit will be related to each
divide and conquer divide the program into disjoint subprograms as each module not related to each

8) What is FlowChart

Graphical reprsentation of the process

Please refer the symbols in the ppt 

1) process

2)input/output

3) variable declaration

4) subroutines

5) continution

Algorithm : Step by step execution of given program.

Properties of Algorithm : 

(i) Finiteness

2) Definiteness

3) Input

4) output

5) Effectiveness

Data Structures : 
___________________

What is DataStructure : Implements mechanism of Storing/Accessing and Manipulating data in efficient ways.

What are types of Data Structures

Static Data Structures : Arrays 

Dynamic Data Structures : LinkedLIst

	Linear

	Non-Linear : Trees

What is diff. between Arrays and LinkedList

Arrays are best to access the data, where linkedLists are best to Perform Insert/Update and Delete Operations.

Which Search Mechanism is best one

1) Linear Search 2) Binary Search 3) Binary Search Tree Traversal 

Which Ds allows you to store elements as always last element deleted 

STACK

which ds allows you to evaluate mathematic expression syntaxes 

STACK

What is the diff. between LIbear Search and Binary Search

Binary search is more efficeint as every iteration 50% of elements are discarded. 

Which sorting mechansim always checks for small element in list and to be sorted out.

Selection Sort

Which sorting mechasim ensures after first iteration max. value to be placed in correct position

Bubble sort

Which sorting mechasim takes pivot and sorts

QuickSort

Which sorting mechansims follow divide and conquer approach

Merge Sort and Quick Sort

What is tree

Non-linear data structures. 

What are tree traversals 

INOrder

Pre-Order

Post-Order 

*** They gives a diagram and asks for post-order/pre-order/in-order 


Tree Travesal technique to balance the tree w.r.t. balance factor is (AVL Tree) 

What is the bench mark for AVL tree balance factor (2 or -2)

1) When the sprint execution completed 

Starts after spring planning and ends before the sprint review 

Sprint Review meeting followed by sprint retrospective meeting then only we say sprint completed. 

2) Who is responsible for Product Catalog 

Product Owner

3) What is the Difference between Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog 

Product backlog contains User-Stories as contains requirements about project. 

Sprint backlog the team accepts the one of user-story from product backlog
 and divides into tasks, each task will be specified with timelines that is called sprint backlog

5) Goals of Scrum 

Manage Complexity, Unpredictability and change through visibility, Inspection and Adoption 

10) What will happen in Sprint 

    Product Design, Code, and Test, typical duration is from 2 to 4 weeks, but it can't cross calendar month


11) What is Daily Standup Meeting 

12) What is Validation and Verification 

13) Agile works on which priorities

MOSCOW
